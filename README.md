This repository contains image assets used by Google Apps Script, and provides a simple URL redirect to the NYJC We Are Not Lemons Volunteer Attendance Portal.

The NYJC We Are Not Lemons Volunteer Attendance Portal utilises Google Sheets as the backend database and Google Apps Script for the frontend, which is a basic HTML website. The website allows We Are Not Lemons volunteers to check their attendance and track the number of volunteer hours they have accumulated.
